# Fab Collection Tool

Manage your collection in an Open Document Spreadsheet (ODS).  
Then export the ODS contents to your favorite collection manager.

## How to

You'll find an example ODS file in the docs folder.  
This is an example how to edit it.  
Names of the cards and their IDs must match the names and IDs given 
by Legend Story Studios (LSS).

To create import files for other collection managers, start the 
FabCollectionTool.exe file.

If you're asked for the path to the ODS file, copy path 
including file and file extension.  
Example: D:\Projects\FabCollectionTool\docs\example.ods

If you have copied the ODS file into the same directory as the 
FabCollectionTool.exe file, you can also just give the filename including extension.  
Example: example.ods

Follow the dialogs.

Afterwards you should find a file in the FabCollectionTool.exe folder according to your 
created export.  
Example: fabrary.csv

Have fun ;-)

## Hints

To raise Libre Office Calc performance on Windows while editing, 
turn of "Auto Calculation".

Use "Paste special" and select "All" when copy and paste rows to keep formulars 
and conditional styles.

Conditional styles only work if "Auto Calculation" is enabled.

Only the blue cells are needed to export. You may add more cols if you like or delete them.
